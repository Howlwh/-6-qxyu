# This controls the final target resolution
# For example, if your game resolution is 2560x1440, and you set this to 1.5, then DLSS will upscale from 2560x1440 to 3840x2160, then downsampling it back to 2560x1440 to fit your viewport.
# And then if you have set the framescaling to 0.75 in your game setting, then DLSS will upscale from 1920x1080 to 3840x2160, then downsampling it back to 2560x1440 to fit your viewport.

# 0 = Default, use the default preset for corresponding quality level
# 1 = Preset A (intended for Perf/Balanced/Quality modes):

#
# 2 = Preset B (intended for Ultra Perf mode): 
#      *Similar to Preset A but for Ultra Performance mode
#
# 3 = Preset C (intended for Perf/Balanced/Quality modes):
#      *Preset which generally favors current frame information. Generally well-suited for fastpaced game content
#
# 4 = Preset D (intended for Perf/Balanced/Quality modes):
#      *The default preset for Perf/Balanced/Quality mode. Generally favors image stability

# 6 = Preset F (intended for Ultra Perf/DLAA modes):
#      *The default preset for Ultra Perf and DLAA modes.
